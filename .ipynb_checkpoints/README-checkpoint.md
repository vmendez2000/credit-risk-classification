# Credit-Risk-Classification Project

## Overview

#### This project utilizes logistic regression to analyze credit risk and classify loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1). The dataset contains various financial indicators such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, and derogatory marks to predict loan status.

## File Structure
    * Credit_Risk/
        * Resources/
            * lending_data.csv - Dataset used for training and testing.
        * credit_risk_classification.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing data processing, model training, and evaluation.
        * Credit_Risk_Report.md - credit risk analysis report

    * README.md - Documentation and project details.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

    * Load and explore dataset.
    * Separate features (X) and target variable (y).
    * Split dataset into training and testing sets.

### 2. Model Training

    * Implement logistic regression.
    * Train model using training data.

### 3. Evaluation

    * Generate confusion matrix and classification report.
    * Assess precision, recall, and accuracy scores.

## Model Performance

    * Accuracy: 99%
    * Precision: 1.00 (healthy loans), 0.87 (high-risk loans)
    * Recall: 1.00 (healthy loans), 0.95 (high-risk loans)

## Conclusion

#### The logistic regression model performs well with high accuracy and recall. However, some misclassification occurs with high-risk loans, which should be considered before deploying in financial decision-making processes.
